# Navigating-a-Turtlebot3-through-maze-checkpoints
This was the Final Project of Robotics Programming using C++ course (ENPM809Y)
This assignment consisted of the following steps:
– Create a map of the environment (already provided).
– Load the generated map (already performed).
– Read one ArUCo marker and retrieve the appropriate parameters.
– Detect parts using logical cameras.
– Write an action client to go through each part using the order described by
the parameters.

Setup and Installation
• ArUco marker detection requires the latest version of OpenCV.
– pip3 uninstall opencv-python
– pip3 uninstall opencv-contrib-python
– pip3 install opencv-contrib-python

• To install ROS packages for this assignment, it is recommended to create a new
workspace.
– cd
– mkdir -p ~/final_ws/src
– cd final_ws
- place the package from this repository in the src folder
– colcon build

Launch the simualation mize by running the following command
ros2 launch final_project final_project.launch.py

run the script node using
ros2 run lecture12 navigator_23
